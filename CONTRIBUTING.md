### Suggesting enhancements

To suggest a new feature or enhancement of the code first make sure that you have read the [documentation](blob/master/README.md) carefully and understand the functionality. You can also search for a similar issue to make sure that said suggestion is not duplicated or already being implemented.
In case you would like to suggest a new feature, you must make a strong case to convince the project team that it is worth pursuing.

To start a suggestion please open a [Github issue](/issues/new) where we will ask you to:

- Use a **descriptive** title.
- Provide a description of the feature or enhancement with as many details as possible.
- **Explain why this feature or enhancement** would be useful. You can use references to other projects or websites if you need to.

In case that the project team decide that the feature or enhancement is worth pursuing, you will be asked to open a Pull Request which will be [referenced](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) to this issue.
After that you will need approval from the project team to merge the feature into the project itself.
